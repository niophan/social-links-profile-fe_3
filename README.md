## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

While working through this project i recap of how to use internal CSS and make custom cursor


### Continued development

I tried to make a custom cursor to match the cursor's color in the design, but then i figured out that custom cursors is inconsistent across browsers. Below syntax helps to customer the cursor with a picture, but then again need to figure out the default cursor size to match with the original cursor.
```css
.cursor { cursor: url(images/my-cursor-design.png), auto; }
```
